Enforces extended member ordering.

Order for regular classes can be confugured by `order`. To configure widget class members order use `widgets-order`.

The value for the `order` or `widgets-order` entries should match the following pattern:

`< (overridden | protected)- >< (private | public)- >< static- >< late- >< (var | final | const)- >< nullable- >< named- >< factory- > (fields | getters | getters-setters | setters | constructors | methods) `

where values in the `<>` are optional, values in the `()` are interchangeable and the last part of the pattern which represents a class member type is **REQUIRED**.

:::info

Not all of the pattern parts are applicable for every case, for example, `late-constructors` are not expected, since they are not supported by the language itself.

:::

For example, the value for `order` or `widgets-order` may be an array consisting of the following strings:

- public-late-final-fields
- private-late-final-fields
- public-nullable-fields
- private-nullable-fields
- named-constructors
- factory-constructors
- getters
- setters
- public-static-methods
- private-static-methods
- protected-methods
- etc.

You can simply configure the rule to sort only by a type:

- fields
- methods
- setters
- getters (or just **getters-setters** if you don't want to separate them)
- constructors

The default config for `order` is:

- public-fields
- private-fields
- public-getters
- private-getters
- public-setters
- private-setters
- constructors
- public-methods
- private-methods

The default config for `widgets-order` is ([from Flutter style guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo#order-other-class-members-in-a-way-that-makes-sense)):

- constructor
- named-constructor
- const-fields
- static-methods
- final-fields
- init-state-method
- var-fields
- init-state-method
- private-methods
- overridden-public-methods
- build-method

The `alphabetize` option will enforce that members within the same category should be alphabetically sorted by name.

The `alphabetize-by-type` option will enforce that members within the same category should be alphabetically sorted by theirs type name.

:::note

Only one alphabetize option could be applied at the same time.

### ⚙️ Config example {#config-example}

With the default config:

```yaml
dart_code_metrics:
  ...
  rules:
    ...
    - member-ordering
```

**OR** with a custom one:

```yaml
dart_code_metrics:
  ...
  rules:
    ...
    - member-ordering:
        alphabetize: true
        order:
          - public-fields
          - private-fields
          - constructors
```

**OR** Flutter specific:

```yaml
dart_code_metrics:
  ...
  rules:
    ...
    - member-ordering:
        order:
          - build-method
          - init-state-method
          - did-change-dependencies-method
          - did-update-widget-method
          - dispose-method
```
