# Metrics overview

Metrics are grouped by a category to help you understand their purpose.

Metrics configuration is [described here](../getting-started/configuration#configuring-a-metrics-entry).

## Function specific metrics {#function-specific-metrics}

- [Cyclomatic Complexity](./cyclomatic-complexity.md)
  
    The number of linearly-independent paths through a method.

- [Halstead Volume](./halstead-volume.md)

    The method size, based on the numbers of operators and operands.

- [Lines of Code](./lines-of-code.md)

    The number of physical lines of code of a method, including blank lines and comments.

- [Maintainability Index](./maintainability-index.md)

    The indicator which mean how maintainable the source code is.

- [Maximum Nesting](./maximum-nesting-level.md)

    The maximum nesting level of control structures within a method.

- [Number of Parameters](./number-of-parameters.md)

    The number of parameters received by a method.

- [Source lines of Code](./source-lines-of-code.md)

    The approximate number of source code lines in a method, blank lines and comments are not counted.

## Class specific metrics {#class-specific-metrics}

- [Number of Methods](./number-of-methods.md)

    The number of methods of a class.

- [Weight of a Class](./weight-of-class.md)

    The number of "functional" public methods divided by the total number of public members.

## File specific metrics {#file-specific-metrics}

- [Technical Debt](./technical_debt.md)

    The cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
