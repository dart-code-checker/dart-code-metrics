# Anti-patterns overview

Anti-patterns configuration is [described here](../getting-started/configuration#configuring-an-anti-pattern-entry).

Available anti-patterns:

- [Long Method](./long-method.md)

    Long blocks of code are difficult to reuse and understand because they are usually responsible for more than one thing.

- [Long Parameter List](./long-parameter-list.md)

    Long parameter lists are difficult to understand and use.
