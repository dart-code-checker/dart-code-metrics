If your PR fixes an issue, you can add `#issue_number` into this
PR description. Please don't reference the issue with `closes` (or other) syntax
since we close the issues only after the code is released.

If you added a new lint rule, here's a checklist for things that will be
checked during review or continuous integration.

- \[ ] Red the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/dart-code-checker/dart-code-metrics/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- \[ ] Followed lint naming conventions
- \[ ] Tests pass locally
- \[ ] Updated the changelog

Note that you can skip the above if you are just opening a WIP PR in
order to get feedback.

Since the website was moved out from this repo, please add the rule documentation in the description.
Refer to [this documentation](https://dcm.dev/docs/individuals/rules/common/format-comment/) as an example.
