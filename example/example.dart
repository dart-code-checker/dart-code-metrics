  // There is also JsonReporter for making machine-readable reports
  // HtmlReporter produces fancy html-documents with bells and whistles
  // And CodeClimateReporter produces reports that are widely understood by various CI tools
  // If none of these fits your case you can always access raw analysis info via results() method of runner and process it any way you see fit
